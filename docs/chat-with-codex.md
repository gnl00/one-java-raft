• I’m gathering the main problems with this Raft implementation, focusing on correctness and missing core Raft features like proper vote handling, leader heartbeats, and term comparisons. I’ll note file paths and line numbers to back each point and then suggest
improvements for better liveness and safety. Let’s explore these key bugs and practical next steps for fixing them.

> Key Issues

- src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:161 把“是否已经为某个候选人投票”压成一个全局 hasCandidate 标志，但从未按 term 重置；节点第一次投票后，这个 CAS 永远返回 false，后续任意任期都拿不到选票，集群失去活性。应维护 per-term 的 votedFor 并在收到更高 term 时清空。
- src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:64 与 src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:198 中 hasLeader 一旦被设为 true 就永不会恢复为 false，而且 leader 也只发送一次 AppendEntries。如果 leader 宕机或网络分区，其他节点仍认为集群有 leader，不会重新选举。需要在 leader 周
  期性发送心跳，同时 follower 基于“上次心跳时间”判断超时后清空 hasLeader。
- src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:112 的 appendEntries() 只在上任瞬间广播一次心跳；没有调度器维持 50~150ms 周期心跳，也没有复制日志/响应处理逻辑，所以协议既缺乏 leader 健康检查，也无法推进 commitIndex。
- src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:75 启动选举时没有自投且不重置 electionVoteCounts，handleVoteGranted 里 incrementAndGet() 会累积上一次选举的旧票甚至直接达标或永远达不到过半。应该在发起选举时把计数器重置为 1（自投票），失败或超时时重新归零。
- src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:160 处理 RequestVote 时既不比较 term，也不校验 lastLogIndex/lastLogTerm，对落后 candidate 仍可能回 true；同时没把更高 term 写回自己的 currentTerm 与 votedFor。这破坏了 Raft 的安全性。

Next Steps

1. 引入标准 Raft 状态：currentTerm、votedFor、commitIndex、lastApplied，在 RPC 中严格按论文流程更新/校验。
2. 用调度器分别驱动 election timeout 与 leader heartbeat，heartbeat 失败或超时后清空 hasLeader/votedFor，重新参加选举。
3. 让 RequestVote/AppendEntries 都返回响应对象（带成功标志与 term），在 candidate/leader 侧根据响应调整 term、退回 follower、推进日志复制。
4. 将日志列表、prevLogIndex、prevLogTerm 真正接入状态机，并补充单元/集成测试验证重新选举、日志覆盖、网络闪断等场景。

• I’m examining the new RaftNode code and noticing several critical issues: missing initialization of heartbeatTimestamp causes null pointer exceptions (notably src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:54-56), gatherVoteCount isn’t reset with self-vote on new elections
leading to faulty majority tracking (RaftNode.java:64-67, 80-87), checkTimeout only re-triggers elections from follower state leaving candidates stuck without new elections (RaftNode.java:60), and voteGranted neglects term comparisons allowing outdated candidates to get
votes (RaftNode.java:72, RaftServer.java:153). I see leaderId and votedFor are inconsistently updated, risking stale leadership states. Overall, timing and state transitions need tightening to avoid crashes and stalled elections. Let’s pinpoint these in a findings bullet
list for clarity.

> Findings

- Bug: heartbeatTimestamp defaults to null, so the first checkTimeout call dereferences it and throws NullPointerException; leaders also never set this field, so even after initialization the logic immediately flags a timeout for the current leader (src/main/java/one/
  oraft/RaftNode.java:36, src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:54).
- Bug: Once a node flips to STATE_CANDIDATE, checkTimeout no longer triggers (condition requires STATE_FOLLOWER), so if it fails to win a majority it never restarts the election cycle (src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:60).
- Bug: Beginning a new election doesn’t reset vote bookkeeping; you never self‑vote (votedFor stays -1) and gatherVoteCount keeps the prior round’s value, so a node can either win immediately with stale votes or never reach quorum (src/main/java/one/oraft/
  RaftNode.java:60, src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:80).
- Bug: Voting ignores term checks—voteGranted accepts any request while the node is follower and idle, and handleRequestVote never bumps currentTerm when a higher‑term candidate arrives; this violates Raft’s safety rules and lets stale candidates steal votes (src/main/
  java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:152, src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:72).

• Analyzing voting and term update issues

This is a detailed look at remaining bugs around vote granting and currentTerm updates. I’m noticing the follower doesn’t update its currentTerm when receiving higher term votes and fails to reset votedFor accordingly, which could cause outdated elections and block new
legitimate candidates. The requestVote responses also don’t convey the follower’s true term back to candidates, so candidates can’t detect higher terms and step down properly. These are important RAFT protocol problems still needing fixes!

Assessing AppendEntries heartbeat handling

I'm seeing that handleAppendEntries updates the heartbeat timestamp even when receiving entries with stale terms below currentTerm, which can block follower election timeouts by treating outdated heartbeats as valid. This breaks RAFT rules since followers should reject
AppendEntries with stale terms, so this needs a closer look and clear feedback referencing source lines.

• I’m reviewing key problems in the vote granting and term handling code, especially in RaftNode.voteGranted around line 92—where the lack of resetting votedFor on new higher terms can prevent elections. Also, the response in RaftServer.handleRequestVote (around line 157)
returns the request's term instead of the follower's current term, breaking term updates on candidates. Additionally, I’m noting issues with heartbeat timestamp updates for stale terms and inconsistent leader ID resets after term changes. These points seem crucial to
highlight in severity order given the modifications.

• Preparing final review message structure

> - src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:92 – voteGranted still refuses to vote once votedFor is set, even if the incoming request carries a higher term. After voting in term T and failing to hear from that candidate, the node keeps votedFor != -1; when a new candidate
    shows up with term T+1 we should adopt the newer term and grant the vote, but this code returns false, stalling the election. Reset currentTerm, votedFor, leaderId, and related state whenever term > currentTerm before evaluating the vote conditions.
- src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:158 – The RequestVote reply echoes the candidate’s term (term from the request) instead of the responder’s node.getCurrentTerm(). Because of this, a stale candidate (term 3) talking to a newer follower (term 5) never learns about
  the higher term and therefore never steps down, violating Raft’s requirement that higher terms propagate immediately.

Addressing those two spots will let nodes adopt newer terms and converge on a leader reliably.

▌ 我修改了：RequestVote 使用 node.getCurrentTerm()。关于 voteGranted still refuses to vote once votedFor is set 的问题我有两个修复方案：1、voteGranted 中直接去掉 votedFor.equals(-1)；2、RaftNode#checkTimeout 中添加判断        if (electionTimestamp == -1) {
▌             electionTimestamp = System.currentTimeMillis();
▌         }
▌         if (state == State.STATE_FOLLOWER && votedFor != -1
▌                 && System.currentTimeMillis() - electionTimestamp > ELECTION_TIMEOUT * 1000
▌         ) {
▌             votedFor = -1;
▌         } \n 我知道方案二肯定可以实现，我现在想跟你讨论方案一，如果使用方案一来实现的话：如果节点a发送了投票请求，term=2；节点b发送了投票请求，term=3，这种情况下岂不是会给两个节点都投一次票？这和raft规定的每个节点只能投一次票的规则违背了吗？

> - 方案一中简单移除 votedFor == -1 的判断会让同一 term 内给多个候选人投票。因为现在 votedFor 永远不会被回收，在 term=2 投票给节点 A 后，又能在 term=2 再投给节点 B，这直接违反了“每个任期最多投一票”的 Raft 约束，存在安全隐患。
- 正确的做法是在收到比自己更高的 term 时，先把自身 currentTerm 升级，并重置 votedFor、leaderId、state 等状态，然后再按“本任期是否已经投票”判断。如果 term == currentTerm 且 votedFor == candidateId，允许重复返回 true；如果 votedFor == -1，可以把票给这个候选人；否则拒绝。
- 方案二通过超时来重置 votedFor 虽然可行，但治标不治本：真正触发投票的事件是“看到更高 term 的请求”，应立即升级并重置 votedFor，不该等待额外的超时。建议合并两条逻辑：当 term > currentTerm 时先 reset，再走“同一任期最多投一票”的判断，这样既不会违反单任期一票，又能及时响应更
  高任期的候选人。

• I'll focus on key issues around voteGranted’s idempotency, the premature follower-to-candidate transitions due to leaderId being -1 without resetting election timers after voting, missing electionTimestamp updates on vote grants, and lack of periodic heartbeats after
leadership is assumed. These points highlight potential election thrashing and protocol deviations mainly in RaftNode.java lines 71 and 103. I'll also note some naming oddities and missing log checks as secondary concerns.

> - src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:103 仍然只在 votedFor == -1 时返回 true；如果同一个候选人在同一任期里重复发送 RequestVote（或重试后被延迟送达），这里会直接返回 false。Raft 要求“同一任期最多投一票”，但也期望对已经投过票的候选人保持幂等，所以需要在 votedFor ==
    candidateId 时也返回 true。否则候选人会把这当成拒绝，误以为自己没拿到票。
- src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:71 只要 leaderId == -1 就立刻把 follower 转成 candidate。现在当节点刚给别人投完票时，leaderId 仍是 -1，下一轮 checkTimeout（约 3 秒后）就会重新发起竞选，导致多个候选人并发、选举难以收敛。Raft 规范里，收到 RequestVote 或
  AppendEntries 都要重置选举超时；可以在 voteGranted() 成功时更新 heartbeatTimestamp/electionTimestamp，或仅在超过 LEADER_TIMEOUT 时才触发候选人转换。
- src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:158 虽然响应里改成了 node.getCurrentTerm()，但因为上面两个问题，候选人仍会频繁收到“拒绝”或马上又转为候选人，集群依旧难以稳定。建议先修正 voteGranted 幂等性并在授票时刷新超时，再观察选举是否按预期推进。

• I'm checking the RAFT implementation for timeout and voting issues. The main problem is followers get stuck after voting because their votedFor doesn’t reset when a candidate fails, blocking new elections. Also, voteGranted resets leaderId on a higher term but doesn’t
update heartbeat or election timestamps, risking immediate elections. I’m gathering details and line references to summarize these critical bugs clearly with bullet points and optional questions.

> - src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:49 / src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:103 – After a follower grants a vote (votedFor set to the candidate id), there is no code path that resets votedFor back to -1 unless the candidate later sends an AppendEntries RPC. If
    that candidate crashes before broadcasting heartbeats, the follower can never start a new election (condition at line 49 keeps failing) nor vote for another candidate, so the cluster loses availability. The spec requires followers to “forget” their vote when an election
    timeout elapses without hearing from the granted candidate (or upon seeing a newer term).
- src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:135 – When a follower receives AppendEntries, you reset the leader info but never refresh electionTimestamp. Because checkTimeout() only initializes electionTimestamp when the node becomes candidate, a follower that keeps receiving
  heartbeats continues to compare the current time against an old electionTimestamp == -1, which leaves the “candidate timeout” branch unreachable later on (and makes the eventual vote-reset suggested above hard to implement correctly). Refresh the election timer whenever
  a leader interaction succeeds.

• I’m untangling how electionTimestamp stays at -1 for followers after voting, causing immediate vote resets on timeout checks. It looks like the timestamp isn’t properly updated when voting or granting votes, leading to premature election restarts and potential
instability. I’ll highlight these issues and suggest setting electionTimestamp when votes are cast or append entries are received to avoid unintended rapid elections.

> - src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:40/src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:71 – After a follower grants a vote, electionTimestamp is still -1. Your new timeout clause now checks System.currentTimeMillis() - electionTimestamp > …; because electionTimestamp remains
    -1, the difference is effectively “now – (‑1)”, so the condition is true on the very next scheduler tick. As a result the follower immediately resets votedFor back to -1, which makes the original vote vanish before the candidate has any chance to win. To fix this you
    need to stamp electionTimestamp = System.currentTimeMillis() at the point where the follower casts a vote (and also whenever it receives a heartbeat/AppendEntries), so that the timer measures real elapsed time instead of the “since epoch” artifact.

• I'm carefully reviewing the RAFT election timeout logic and state changes, focusing on when and how electionTimestamp, leaderId, and votedFor are updated. There are nuanced interactions that might cause premature or repeated candidacy, heartbeat scheduling gaps from the
leader, and potential synchronization issues due to fixed timeouts and lack of randomized delays. I’m noting that while vote granting resets timestamps, some edge cases—like resetting leaderId without updating electionTimestamp—could cause quick repeated elections. I'll
highlight these possible pitfalls and verify alignment with RAFT protocol expectations.

Identifying candidate step-down omission and timeout quirks

I'm spotting a critical bug where candidates don't step down upon receiving a VoteGranted response with a higher term but false voteGranted—this violates RAFT and risks stale leadership. Also, the timeout logic lets followers rapidly re-enter candidacy without waiting a
randomized backoff, which might cause frequent elections. I plan to highlight these with severity and line references for thorough feedback.

leader only sends one AppendEntries heartbeat without periodic renewals, so followers time out after the LEADER_TIMEOUT period, which remains unresolved. I'll mention these with severity levels and relevant file references to clarify their impact.

> - High – src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:164: 当 candidate 收到 VoteGranted RPC 时，只用 tryUpgradeToLeader 处理 voteGranted == true 的场景，而对 voteGranted == false 但返回 term > currentTerm 的情况完全忽略。根据 Raft 规范，一旦看到更高的 term，candidate 必须立
    刻更新自己的 currentTerm 并退回 follower；否则它会一直停留在旧任期，持续发起无效选举/心跳，集群无法收敛。建议在 handleVoteGranted 中检测到 term > node.getCurrentTerm() 时直接调用新的 “step down” 逻辑，重置 currentTerm/state/votedFor 等字段。
- High – src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:105 & src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftNode.java:142: appendEntries() 只在成为 leader 的瞬间发送一次心跳。由于 NettyClient、appendEntries 都没有周期性调用，followers 的 heartbeatTimestamp 在一轮之后不再刷新，checkTimeout() 经过
  LEADER_TIMEOUT（15s）便会重新把 leaderId 置为 -1 并发起新一轮选举，导致系统不停震荡。需要为 leader 安排定时任务，持续以远小于 LEADER_TIMEOUT 的周期广播 AppendEntries/心跳消息。

• I'm scrutinizing how heartbeat tasks are scheduled and not canceled, causing old leaders to keep sending heartbeats after stepping down. The unused static executor in RaftNode is a code smell. The stepDown method should update heartbeat timestamps to prevent immediate
re-elections, but currently, it doesn't, which may trigger premature candidacy. Also, tracking ScheduledFutures from scheduled heartbeats is missing, so cancellation isn't possible, which is a critical oversight.

• I’m reviewing RaftNode and RaftServer code, uncovering two key problems: heartbeat tasks aren’t canceled on stepping down, so followers keep sending heartbeats erroneously, and appendEntries runs regardless of state, causing conflicting leader claims. I’m also noting
that the scheduled executor is unused, and suggesting tracking ScheduledFuture to cancel tasks properly. There are some subtler timing and state update gaps around heartbeatTimestamp and election timestamps worth mentioning too. This focus will shape the detailed review
with severity flags.

> Findings

- High – src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:170 schedules a fixed-rate heartbeat task when the node becomes leader but never tracks or cancels it. After the node steps down (e.g., RaftNode.tryUpgradeToLeader calls stepDown on a higher term), the scheduled job keeps
  firing and still invokes appendEntries(), so a follower continues to broadcast heartbeats and claims leadership for subsequent terms. This violates Raft’s single-leader guarantee and prevents convergence. Store the returned ScheduledFuture, add a guard in appendEntries()
  (or both), and cancel the task whenever the node leaves STATE_LEADER.

Next Steps

1. Capture the ScheduledFuture<?> from scheduleAtFixedRate, persist it on the server, and cancel it inside a new “step down”/onBecomeFollower hook that runs whenever the node relinquishes leadership.

line 113. It looks like the current logic cancels the scheduled future when the node isn't leader, but doesn't verify if leaderScheduledFuture is non-null before canceling, which is a high-severity bug. I'm considering how stepDown and leader election interact with this
scheduled future and realizing that the cancel call might happen inside the running future itself, which has some concurrency nuances but is less critical than the null pointer issue. I plan to highlight these bugs and suggest adding null checks before cancel calls and
possibly resetting leaderScheduledFuture after cancellation to avoid stale references. I'll also pinpoint the exact file and line numbers for the user’s review message.

• Ran git status --short

• Ran git diff src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java

• I’m analyzing how tryStopScheduled cancels scheduled leader heartbeats but appendEntries still sends one more heartbeat after stepping down, which contradicts Raft behavior. There’s a missing early return after cancellation in appendEntries (around RaftServer.java:107),
causing a high-severity bug where the node broadcasts heartbeats even after it loses leadership. Also, while tryStopScheduled safely checks for null futures, it never nullifies leaderScheduledFuture after canceling, and cancellation is only triggered when node ID differs
from leader ID. The overall review focuses on confirming these concerns and recommending an immediate exit after cancellation to prevent stale heartbeats.

> Findings

- High – src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java:107: appendEntries() now calls tryStopScheduled() but still goes on to broadcast the heartbeat even when leaderScheduledFuture was just cancelled (i.e., this node has already stepped down and node.getId() !=
  node.getLeaderId()). Per Raft, once you revert to follower you must immediately stop advertising yourself as leader; this call keeps publishing one more heartbeat in the stale term and confuses the cluster. Return immediately after cancelling (or guard before serialising
  the RPC), otherwise the just-demoted node still claims leadership.

▌ 我决定移除 tryStopScheduled 方法，并帮忙查看最新的修改。

• Ran git diff src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java

• I'm carefully reviewing how scheduled futures are canceled and reassigned during leadership changes in the RaftNode. There are a few concurrency nuances around canceling without nullifying references, possible race conditions during stepDown and leader transitions, and

clearer handling of the scheduled future’s lifecycle and visibility.

> Looks good—no new critical issues. Cancelling the heartbeat task when the node is no longer leader removes the stale-heartbeat path I pointed out earlier, and the guard in appendEntries() prevents extra messages once demoted.

One minor polish: after leaderScheduledFuture.cancel(true) (both in checkTimeout() and appendEntries()), you could set the field back to null so repeated cancellations don’t keep trying to cancel the same future. Functionally it works as-is, though, because the scheduled
job stops after the first cancel.

Otherwise this update keeps the election flow in line with Raft’s expectations.

▌ 我添加了：stopLeaderScheduled 帮忙看看现在的实现如何？

• Ran git diff src/main/java/one/oraft/RaftServer.java

> Looks solid. By centralizing the cancellation in stopLeaderScheduled() and nulling out the handle you’ve removed the duplicate cancellation logic and ensured the old heartbeat job can’t keep running. The guard (Objects.nonNull) keeps you safe from NPEs, and
appendEntries() now exits immediately after cancelling, so a demoted node won’t send stray heartbeats.

Functionally this meets the Raft requirement: only a leader keeps scheduling heartbeats, and stepping down stops them cleanly before the next broadcast.
